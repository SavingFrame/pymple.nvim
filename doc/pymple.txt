This plugin attempts to provide missing utilities when working with Python
inside Neovim.

These utilities include:
- automatic renaming of imports when renaming/moving a file or a folder
- automatic symbol import resolution based on your current workspace and
  installed python packages
- automatic and configurable creation of test files that mirror your project
  structure

See examples below.
