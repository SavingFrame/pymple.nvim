# üñçÔ∏è pymple.nvim
All your missing Python IDE features for Neovim (WIP ü§ì).

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Requirements
- the [plenary.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/plenary.nvim) lua package
- the [grip-grab](https://github.com/alexpasmantier/grip-grab) rust search utility (>= 0.2.16)
- a working version of [sed](https://www.gnu.org/software/sed/)

## üì¶ Installation
### Using Lazy
```lua
return {
  {
    "alexpasmantier/pymple.nvim",
    dependencies = {
      "nvim-lua/plenary.nvim",
    },
    config = function()
      require("pymple").setup()
    end,
  },
}
```
### Using Packer
```lua
use {
  "alexpasmantier/pymple.nvim",
  requires = {
    "nvim-lua/plenary.nvim",
  },
  config = function()
    require("pymple").setup()
  end,
}
```

## ‚ú® Current features
- [x] Automatically refactor workspace imports on file move/rename
- [x] `Code action`-like bindable user command to automatically add missing import for symbol under cursor

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
The configuration is currently quite limited, but you can change the following options:
```lua
config = {
  -- automatically register the following keymaps on plugin setup
  keymaps = {
    -- Resolves import for symbol under cursor.
    -- This will automatically find and add the corresponding import to the top of
    -- the file (below any existing doctsring)
    add_import_for_symbol_under_cursor = {
      keys = "<leader>li",  -- feel free to change this to whatever you like
      desc = "Resolve import under cursor", -- description for the keymap
    },
  },
  -- automatically create the following user commands on plugin setup
  create_user_commands = {
    -- Update all workspace imports after moving/renaming a file.
    -- This takes two arguments (old_path, new_path)
    -- and can be called as ":UpdatePythonImports old_path new_path"
    update_imports = true,
    -- Resolve import for symbol under cursor and add it to the top
    -- of the current buffer.
    -- This will usually be hooked up by pymple on setup to your file
    -- explorer's events and get triggered automatically when you move
    -- or rename a file or a folder.
    add_import_for_symbol_under_cursor = true,
  },
  -- options for the update imports feature
  update_imports = {
    -- the filetypes on which to run the update imports command
    -- NOTE: this should at least include "python" for the plugin to actually do anything useful
    filetypes = { "python", "markdown" },
  },
  -- logging options
  logging = {
    -- whether to enable logging
    enabled = false,
    -- whether to log to a file (default location is nvim's stdpath("data")/pymple.vlog which is usually
    -- `~/.local/share/nvim/pymple.vlog` on unix systems)
    use_file = false,
    -- whether to log to the neovim console (only use this for debugging as it might quickly ruin your neovim experience)
    use_console = false,
    -- the log level to use (one of "trace", "debug", "info", "warn", "error", "fatal")
    level = "debug",
  }
}
```

## üÜò Help
If something's not working as expected, please start by running `checkhealth` inside neovim:
```vim
:checkhealth pymple
```
